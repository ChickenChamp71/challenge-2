                    He was tired. Fuck, he was exhausted.
                    <br><br>
                    Whatever that last creature was took a lot out of him, his heaving breaths still catching up on the oxygen he was missing. It had almost taken a chunk out of his shoulder, he was lucky he'd noticed it before it could pounce. Looking at the body on the floor, its neck sluggishly bleeding from the area he’d severed their spinal cord, he noticed there was a significant amount of meat. Now, at least, he had a guaranteed dinner.
                    <br><br>
                    The Forbidden Forest was more unforgiving than he'd remembered, but he wasn’t in the real world anymore, was he?
                    <br><br>
                    He felt eyes on him again, but these were more familiar. Voldemort must be back.
                    <br><br>
                    "Snallygasters are quite nasty, aren't they?" Harry's neck itched at the smugness in Voldemort's voice, "If only you had someone who knows more about magical creatures to help you, truly a shame." He ended with a wistful sigh.
                    <br><br>
                    Stubbornly, he refused to acknowledge Voldemort’s presence in any way, the only thing noticeable would be the way his jaw clenched.
                    <br><br>
                    Focusing back on his search for shelter, Harry took a step forward only to stumble as his muscles twitched from overuse. The fight had only made his exhaustion worse, and he hadn't taken a break in almost twelve hours. Barely catching himself, he took a moment to steady, but quickly realized his lack of action was making the aches and pains all the more evident. They burned, fighting him in a way awfully reminiscent of the way he'd feel after a dangerously hot day doing the Dursley's gardening for hours on end.
